# Project Overview

The Pizza Sales Analysis project is designed to analyse transactional sales data from a pizza store. The goal is to identify key business insights, trends, 
and KPIs that will help management make informed decisions related to sales, marketing, and operations.

# Business Objectives

. Identify overall revenue, total pizzas sold, and total number of orders.

. Determine sales distribution by pizza category, size, and type.

. Analyse time-based trends in sales (daily, monthly, and yearly).

. Highlight best-selling and least-selling pizzas by revenue and quantity.

. Understand customer purchasing behaviour through Average Order Value (AOV) and Average Pizza per Order.

. Provide visualization dashboards for effective decision-making.

# Conclusion & Recommendations

The analysis provides a comprehensive view of pizza sales performance. Management can 

leverage these insights to: 

• Focus marketing on high-performing categories. 

• Optimize the menu by reconsidering least-selling pizzas.

• Plan inventory and staffing based on sales peaks.

• Monitor KPIs regularly through dashboards for continuous improvement.
